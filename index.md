## What is Wandering Minds?

The name is inspired by the research on creativity in the book "Creativity and the Wandering Mind - Spontaneous and Controlled Cognition - Explorations in Creativity Research" [(link)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louise-Bunce/publication/342474622_Relations_between_imagination_and_creativity/links/5ff82b3645851553a02b15d8/Relations-between-imagination-and-creativity.pdf). A wandering mind is often negatively interpreted as a lack of focus, however research suggests that controlled mind wandering can have significant benefits regarding incubation, creative problem-solving, and ideation.

In the ever-changing landscape of technology, creativity and adaptability are the cornerstone of success.
